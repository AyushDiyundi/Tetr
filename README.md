Creating a README file for a Tetris game project involves providing essential information about the project, its setup, usage instructions, and any additional details that might be useful for someone reviewing or contributing to the project. Hereâ€™s a template for a README file tailored for a Tetris game implemented in JavaFX:
Tetris Game

Description

This project implements the classic Tetris game using JavaFX. Tetris is a tile-matching puzzle video game where players manipulate falling tetrominoes (geometric shapes composed of four square blocks each) to create complete rows, which are then cleared from the playing field. The game ends when the stack of tetrominoes reaches the top of the playing field.
Features

    Classic Tetris gameplay mechanics.
    Falling tetrominoes (shapes include I, J, L, O, S, T, Z).
    Score tracking based on lines cleared.
    Game over detection.
    Simple and intuitive keyboard controls (arrow keys for movement and rotation).
Usage

    Use arrow keys (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) to move and rotate the falling tetrominoes.
    The objective is to create complete horizontal lines of blocks without gaps.
    Each completed line clears from the board and increases the score.
    The game ends when a tetromino cannot be placed at the top of the playing field.
